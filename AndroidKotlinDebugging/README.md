# AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: **Zhihua Zhu**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Android Kotlin Debugging** is an android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes!  **Users can tap on 6 preconfigured buttons to perform different widget tasks.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **📲, 🏋️, 💪**
