# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: **Zhihua Zhu**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Twitch for Mice that Itch** is an android app that was riddle with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes!  **This app follows the same format as the Twitch sign up page, this time with a mouse theme**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üßÄ, üêÅ, üê±**
