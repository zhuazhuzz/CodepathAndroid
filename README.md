# AND101 Project 4 - CodeMath

Submitted by: **Zhihua Zhu**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## Summary

**SpeedConverter** is an android app that **converts user inputted speed in meters per second to mph, kmph, and mach. There is also an easter egg button that matches speeds to real life locomotion examples**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **‚è±,üèéÔ∏è,‚ö°**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] At least one (1) user input
- [x] At least one (1) interactive View
- [x] At least one (1) output of a calculation based on the user input

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Implement ViewBinding to reduce boilerplate code and increase efficiency
- [x] Add at least one (1) additional functionality

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you added to improve the app!
- When the user erases all numbers in the input box, I avoided crashing the program by checking if the EditText was empty and set other Textviews to empty string.
- When the user is bored of the button and goes back to using the EditText, I got rid of the text below the button.
